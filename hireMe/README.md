## Introduction:
A lot of people add fake or incorrect experiences on their resumes so that they clear the first round of resume scanning. Even though they may not get the job eventually but
at least they clear the first round unlike some people who are sincere and honest enough to not alter their details on the resumes. 
This application helps in making the job of Human Resources easier by eliminating the need of calling every previous employer of the candidate to verify his/her details.

## Languages/libraries/frameworks/database used:

1. NODE.JS
2. EXPRESS.JS
3. MONGODB
4. TRUFFLE
5. WEB3
6. GANACHE
7. Smart Contract is written in Solidity

## Conclusion:
The use of blockchain can lead to a different ball game altogether when it comes to verification of data. It also helps save a lot of time and thus, if an application similar to this comes into practice, a company or a firm can choose their next employee faster.
