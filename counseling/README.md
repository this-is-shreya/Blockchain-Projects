# Project Name: DeVerif

## Introduction

There have been times when we couldn't get ahead with the verification process during admission process at colleges because we forgot to carry some documents or lost them on the way. This application helps in making those processes easier by eliminating the need for carrying those documents.

## Languages/libraries/frameworks/database used:

This application was built using:
1. NODE.JS
2. EXPRESS.JS
3. WEB3.JS
4. TRUFFLE
5. GANACHE
6. Smart Contract was written in Solidity
7.  MONGODB

## Conclusion

Thus, with the help of blockchain we can verify whether our details are right online itself! This way we won't have to visit any offices or colleges for the sake of verification.
The logic isn't restricted to the verification at counseling but can be applied anywhere else where verification of documents has to take place.
